                <p>
                    Parents, thank you for your continued support. Below is our weekly course update, important
                    scheduling reminders, and a few action items that can make a big difference for student success.

        <div class="class-section">
            <p>
                We are wrapping up Unit 3 this week and spending time on focused review.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will post a study guide, and <strong>students must complete that study guide in order to qualify for
                    a retake</strong> if they score below 90% on the unit test.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>&gt;&gt; Course_Update: Honors_CS1</h2>
        <div class="class-section">
            <p>
                We are currently working on <strong>Strings</strong> in this unit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Review days are Tuesday and Wednesday. Testing is Thursday (A-Day) and Friday (B-Day).
            </p>
            <p>
                Students who want to retake the test must complete the review material first.

        <h2>&gt;&gt; Course_Update: Advanced_Cloud_Computing</h2>
        <div class="class-section">
            <p>
                We have wrapped up the Generative AI Foundations AWS Academy course.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we begin the Gen AI hands-on material, we will review Cloud Foundations content as we prepare
                for upcoming certification timelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                The district is finalizing certification logistics. Once details are complete, students will receive
                certification vouchers and will be able to schedule their exam through Pearson VUE (virtual or
                in-person proctoring).
            </p>
            <p>
                Retakes for our Gen AI course exam will be <strong>Tuesday next week after school</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In alignment with AWS-style certification expectations, I will no longer release graded tests.
                Instead, students will receive <strong>Domain Proficiency Reports</strong> that break performance down
                by domain and include targeted feedback. This mirrors the real certification environment while still
                helping students improve.

            <h3>&gt;&gt; Academic Integrity: Growth in the Right Direction</h3>
            <p>
                I am seeing many students use AI appropriately—for studying, reviewing, and understanding the
                "why" behind concepts instead of just asking for answers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even so, I still run into cases where I cannot fully hear a student's individual voice in classwork and
                homework responses. This does not automatically mean dishonesty, but it does raise concerns and prompts
                closer review.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please continue encouraging students to use AI as a learning tool, not as a replacement for their own
                thinking.
            </p>

            <h3>&gt;&gt; Parent Action Items</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Please help us prioritize tutorials, especially after low test scores (≤75):</strong>
                    If your student is struggling, your encouragement at home makes a real difference. Asking to see
                    recent test scores and talking through a plan to attend tutorials can be the support they need.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Please keep asking about what they are learning:</strong> Questions like "What are you
                    studying in Mr. Rob's class?" show students that their work matters and help build confidence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Please check progress together:</strong> Have your student show completed and missing
                    assignments, then encourage steady follow-through. Small weekly check-ins can prevent bigger
                    issues later.
