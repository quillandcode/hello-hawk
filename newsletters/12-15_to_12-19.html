        <h1>End of Semester Letter</h1>
        
        <p class="intro-text"><strong>To Parents and Guardians,</strong></p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            As we reach the end of the semester, I know this time of year can feel heavy. Between deadlines, exams, and the natural pressure students place on themselves, it's a lot. As a parent of a high-achieving high schooler myself, I understand that stress well. I hope the upcoming break gives your family a chance to rest, reset, and breathe before we begin the next half of the journey.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what students have been working on and share a few observations from the classroom.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>>> System_Status / Accomplishments</h2>
    <p>
        This semester, students built a strong foundation in coding and computer science. Across classes, we focused on core programming skills such as input and output, variables and data types, math operations, working with strings, and loops.
    </p>

    <div class="class-section">
        <h3>Honors Computer Science 1</h3>
        <p>Students explored digital citizenship, how computers work, number systems, and Python.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="class-section">
        <h3>AP Computer Science A</h3>
        <p>Students worked with Java and practiced AP-level problem solving, especially free response questions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="class-section">
        <h3>Advanced Cloud Computing (AWS)</h3>
        <p>Students completed AWS Academy Cloud Foundations material, prepared for the CCP certification, and worked through cloud architecture projects based on client-style scenarios.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        One of the most encouraging signs this semester has been hearing more students talk about code during class. When conversations shift from general chatter to problem solving, debugging, and "why this works," it tells me confidence is growing.
    </p>

    <h2>>> Observations & Growth</h2>
    <p>
        I've also noticed a few patterns worth sharing. Many students improved significantly on test retakes, which shows that they can master the material. At the same time, some students relied on retakes instead of preparing the first time. Others struggled not because the work was beyond them, but because they rushed past instructions or didn't slow down to fully understand what was being asked. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Consistently, the students who study regularly, complete their work on time, and engage with the material tend to feel more confident and perform better overall.</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>>> Alert: Academic Integrity</h3>
        <p>
            I also want to speak honestly about academic integrity. This semester, I addressed several situations involving shortcuts such as copying work, using AI inappropriately, or searching for answers during assessments. I handled many of these with grace, because my goal is not punishment. My goal is to help students grow into learners who trust their own ability and see integrity as the only option. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This kind of culture shift takes time, and I appreciate your help in reinforcing the importance of honesty, effort, and accountability at home. When students support each other in doing the right thing, everyone benefits.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>>> Looking_Forward</h2>
    <p>
        As we head into the break, my hope is that students return next semester rested and ready. Even small habits make a big difference. Short, consistent study time. Careful reading. Willingness to wrestle with a problem before asking for the answer. These are the skills that carry students forward, not just in computer science, but in any challenging field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for the trust you place in me and for the support you give your students. It's been a privilege to teach them this semester. I hope your break is restful and refreshing, and I look forward to continuing our work together in the new year.
    </p>
