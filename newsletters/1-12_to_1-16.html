                <strong>>> STATUS: ONLINE</strong><br>
                Momentum initialized. Systems running at optimal capacity. The rust has been cleared from our
                processors, and this week showed me exactly what I hoped to see: students leveling up, asking powerful
                questions, and proving they're ready for the challenges ahead.

        <h2>>> System_Log: Previous_Week</h2>
        <p>
            Last week delivered some genuinely impressive results. Here's the breakdown:
        </p>

        <div class="class-section">
            <h3>AP Computer Science A</h3>
            <p>
                We tackled the first half of a practice AP exam—real exam conditions, real questions, real pressure. The
                results? <strong>Better than expected.</strong> Considering we're only halfway through the course
                material, students demonstrated solid understanding of core concepts and problem-solving skills. We'll
                complete the second half on Monday and Tuesday, then transition into <strong>Unit 3: Java Classes in
                    Depth</strong>. This is where object-oriented programming truly comes alive, and I'm confident this
                cohort is ready for it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="class-section">
            <h3>Honors Computer Science 1</h3>
            <p>
                We entered the realm of <strong>functions in Python</strong>—the building blocks that transform
                repetitive code into elegant, reusable solutions. Students crushed a practice Free Response Question,
                showing they're not just following along but truly understanding the logic. Impressive work across the
                board. This week, we continue our deep dive into functions, learning how to make our programs more
                <strong>modular, efficient, and powerful</strong>. These are the skills that transform beginners into
                awesome engineers.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="class-section">
            <h3>Advanced Cloud Computing (AWS)</h3>
            <p>
                We shifted gears into preparation for the <strong>AWS AI Practitioner certification</strong>. Students
                are acclimating well to the material, which can feel abstract at first. This week, we continue building
                conceptual understanding of AI and Machine Learning use cases, breaking down those massive umbrella
                terms into digestible, practical knowledge. By the end of this unit, students will understand not just
                <em>what</em> AI is, but <em>when</em> and <em>why</em> to use it.

            <h3>>> SPECIAL EVENT: Expo Night | Wednesday</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>ATTENTION ALL STUDENTS:</strong> This Wednesday is our annual <strong>Expo Night</strong>, where
                we showcase Rock Hill's content pathways to incoming students and their families. Computer Science will
                have a dedicated table, and we need student volunteers to help represent our program.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your student is interested in helping out at the CS table, <strong>please remind them to let us know
                    ASAP</strong>. This is a great opportunity to share their experience and get younger students
                excited about what we do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also—if you know families with students who might be interested in our CS program, spread the word! The
                more future coders we can inspire, the better.
            </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>>> System Alert: Academic Integrity & Learning Culture</h3>
            <p>
                I want to take a moment to acknowledge something important: <strong>the integrity in our classrooms is
                    strong</strong>, and I'm genuinely proud of how our students approach their work. You're building
                something real—skills that will matter far beyond a grade on a transcript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's what I want to emphasize to students and parents alike: <strong>Questions are not weakness—they
                    are strength.</strong> When a student asks a question in class, they're not just helping themselves;
                they're helping at least two or three other people who had the same question but weren't sure if they
                should ask. Every question makes the learning environment stronger for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're creating a space where <strong>failure is not something to hide—it's a learning
                    opportunity</strong>. Debugging code is literally the process of learning from what didn't work.
                That mindset applies to everything we do. So if your student is stuck, encourage them to ask. If they're
                confused, remind them that confusion is the first step toward clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is never perfection on the first try. The goal is growth, understanding, and building the
                confidence to tackle harder problems over time. We're in this together.
