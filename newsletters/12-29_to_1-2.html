            <p class="intro-text">
                <strong>>> INITIATING SEQUENCE...</strong><br>
                Welcome back. I hope the break gave your family time to rest and reset. As we begin the second semester, I want to share what students can expect moving forward.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Second semester is where everything starts to come together. The gap between day-to-day practice and test expectations will be smaller, and assessments will more closely reflect real-world problem solving. This is intentional: the goal is to help students develop independence and persistence.
            </p>

        <h2>>> Module_Updates / Class_Status</h2>

        <div class="class-section">
            <h3>AP Computer Science A</h3>
            <p>
                Instruction and assessments will align more closely with AP expectations. We are shifting focus toward <strong>sustained reasoning</strong> and free-response questions. Students must be ready to work through challenging problems without relying on step-by-step guidance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="class-section">
            <h3>Honors Computer Science 1</h3>
            <p>
                New concepts will continue building directly on first-semester foundations. 
                <br><em>>> DEPENDENCY CHECK:</em> When foundations are solid, students do well. If they are shaky, challenges compound quickly. Consistent practice is the patch for this.

        <div class="class-section">
            <h3>Cloud Computing (AWS)</h3>
            <p>
                We are entering unscripted territory: <strong>AWS AI Practitioner</strong> content. While I bring professional cloud experience to the room, I will be learning portions of this material alongside the students as I work toward the certification myself. This mirrors a real-world tech environment where learning is ongoing and problem-solving happens in unfamiliar territory.

            <h3>>> Security_Policy: Academic Integrity</h3>
            <p>
                I am resetting expectations around integrity. My goal is not just to prevent cheating, but to prepare students for the industry. Shortcuts taken to earn a grade become a handicap later—they rob students of confidence and professional habits. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our CS team is actively working to change the culture behind academic dishonesty. We want students to leave prepared for industry-level work, both technically and professionally.
            </p>

        <h2>>> Support_Protocols</h2>
        <p>Because of increased rigor, consistent preparation matters more than ever. Here is how students can access support:</p>

        <h2>>> Final_Execution_Notes</h2>
        <p>
            I am proud of the growth I saw last semester. Second semester will ask more of the students, but it will also give them opportunities to discover what they are capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your continued partnership. I’m looking forward to a focused, challenging, and rewarding second semester.
        </p>
