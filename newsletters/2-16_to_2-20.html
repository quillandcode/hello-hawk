                <p><strong>&gt;&gt; STATUS: PARTNERSHIP_REQUIRED</strong></p>
                <p>
                    This week, I want to share both celebration and concern. Students are capable of excellent work,
                    and many are showing real growth. At the same time, we are seeing a clear need for stronger
                    follow-through with tutorials and support time—especially after our recent assessment data.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>&gt;&gt; Course_Update: APCSA</h2>
        <div class="class-section">
            <p>
                We have completed our mid-unit test. Results show several students have gaps in understanding that can
                absolutely be fixed with targeted support.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue is not a lack of opportunity—the issue is attendance at tutorials. I offer help before school every day
                and after school on Tuesdays, and currently very few students are using that time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Parent partnership is critical right now:</strong> please encourage (and when needed, require)
                your student to come in with specific questions about assignments, FRQs, or tests. During tutorial, I
                can help students finish assignments, reteach difficult concepts, and coach them on how to self-assess
                so their study time is focused and effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this class, success requires more than attending class and completing CodeHS exercises. Students need
                to actively seek feedback and clarification.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>&gt;&gt; Course_Update: Honors_CS1</h2>
        <div class="class-section">
            <p>
                CS1 is seeing the same pattern. Most students are freshmen and still learning how to manage time,
                advocate for themselves, and ask for help early.
            </p>
            <p>
                As their teacher, I want to provide all possible support while they build those habits. Parent
                reinforcement makes a huge difference at this stage. Please help your student prioritize tutorial time,
                arrive with questions, and treat confusion as part of learning—not a reason to wait.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>&gt;&gt; Course_Update: Advanced_Cloud_Computing</h2>
        <div class="class-section">
            <p>
                This group is doing a great job. We have finished the AWS AI/ML Foundations learning sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Review day: brief class review, practice test, and feedback on commonly missed questions.</li>
                <li>Assessment day: 50-question multiple-choice test over Modules 2–8.</li>
                <li>Students will receive answer-by-answer feedback after testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After we complete the AI unit, we will shift to AWS Cloud Practitioner exam review to prepare for
                district certification vouchers, which should be available soon.

            <h3>&gt;&gt; Academic Integrity: Support First, Accountability Always</h3>
            <p>
                I am taking a remediation-first approach when students make poor choices related to academic integrity.
                My goal is to provide enough support that students do not feel pressured to use shortcuts.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, repeated or habitual violations will still lead to significant consequences. Parents play a
                key role here. Please have direct conversations about integrity, even if you do not currently suspect a
                problem. Those conversations can help students make better choices and influence their peers positively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building a strong "no cheating" culture takes consistent messaging from both school and home.
